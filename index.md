### Getting Started
To get started, follow the installation instructions in the "[Setup](setup/)" tab to install Python 3 on your computer. You'll also need to download the file **[python-lesson.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngeraci/pca-python/gh-pages/data/python-lesson.zip)** from GitHub to your desktop and extract it there (once you have unzipped/extracted the file, you should end up with a folder called “python-lesson”).
